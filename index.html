<p>Leaderboard is aiming to be a multiplayer game services REST API, written in Go. At first stage, the purpose is to provide handling of user registrations and authentication, player data persistence over different games, game and player stat gathering and presentation, as well as allowing to create custom achievements for each game.</p>

<p>For now, there isn't much here as the project is being designed and slowly implemented in the Go programming language. However, when the first stage is completed we can move to adding support for matchmaking, and other multiplayer game services such as in-game chat, web access to player accounts, forums, and in-game purchases. At an even later stage, the possibility of cryptocurrency payments can come under consideration.</p>
